A Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for Jira that allows you to:

- Input a Jira ticket link to fetch issue details and instruct Cursor to fix it
- Retrieve all tickets assigned to you within a specified Jira project
- Filter Jira issues based on a specific issue type and automatically direct Cursor to resolve them
- Manage epics: create new epics, link issues to epics, and view epic hierarchies
- Update issue workflows: transition issues and add comments without leaving your IDE
- Focus on pending work by filtering out completed tasks
- Integrate seamlessly with Jira's API for automation and efficiency

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.17.0 or higher
- A Jira account with API access
- A Jira API token (can be generated at [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens))

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Jira-Context-MCP.git
   cd Jira-Context-MCP
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if you use pnpm
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the example:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your server auth token:
   ```
   MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=change-me
   HTTP_PORT=3000
   ```

### Build

Build the project with:

```bash
npm run build
# or
pnpm build
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

Start the HTTP server:

```bash
npm start
# or
pnpm start
```

Note: In HTTP mode, Jira credentials are provided by each client via headers. The server does not read `JIRA_*` from `.env`.

Or use the CLI mode:

```bash
npm run start:cli
# or
pnpm start:cli
```

CLI mode expects `JIRA_BASE_URL`, `JIRA_USERNAME`, and `JIRA_API_TOKEN` to be provided via environment variables at invocation time.

### Running on Cloudflare Workers (Durable Objects)

This repository now includes a Worker runtime with Durable Object-backed MCP session handling for robust, stateful streamable HTTP support.

1. Create a local dev file for Wrangler:

   ```bash
   cat > .dev.vars <<'EOF'
   MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=change-me
   EOF
   ```

2. Run locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:worker
   ```

3. Set deploy-time secret:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put MCP_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

4. Deploy:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy:worker
   ```

Worker entrypoint: `src/runtimes/worker/entry.ts`

Durable Object session manager: `src/runtimes/worker/session-do.ts`

Optional end-to-end smoke test:

```bash
set -a && source .env.dev && set +a
npm run smoke:worker
```

### User auth (register/login/token)

The Worker runtime now supports user-based API tokens using D1.

1. Create a D1 database:

   ```bash
   bunx wrangler d1 create jira_mcp_auth
   ```

2. Add a D1 binding to `wrangler.toml`:

   ```toml
   [[d1_databases]]
   binding = "AUTH_DB"
   database_name = "jira_mcp_auth"
   database_id = "<DATABASE_ID_FROM_CREATE_OUTPUT>"
   ```

3. Apply schema:

   ```bash
   bunx wrangler d1 execute jira_mcp_auth --file migrations/auth/0001_init_auth.sql
   ```

4. Use auth endpoints:
   - `POST /auth/register` with `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }`
   - `POST /auth/login` with `{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }`
   - `GET /auth/me` with `Authorization: Bearer mcp_...`
   - `GET /auth/tokens` with `Authorization: Bearer mcp_...`
   - `POST /auth/tokens` with `Authorization: Bearer mcp_...`
   - `POST /auth/tokens/revoke` with `Authorization: Bearer mcp_...` and `{ "tokenId": "..." }`

`/auth/login` returns a per-user bearer token (`mcp_...`) that can be used for MCP requests.

Token persistence behavior:

- Tokens are stored in D1 and remain valid across Worker restarts and deploys.
- Set `neverExpires: true` (or `expiresInDays: 0`) to issue non-expiring tokens.
- Revoke tokens with `/auth/tokens/revoke` for immediate invalidation.

If you prefer a browser flow instead of curl, open the auth console UI:

- Run the React app:

  ```bash
  bun --cwd auth-ui install
  bun run dev:auth-ui
  ```

- Open: `http://localhost:5173/auth`

The Vite app uses React Router and proxies `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/mcp`, and `/health` to your Worker runtime.

Proxy target defaults to `http://localhost:8787` and can be changed with:

```bash
VITE_PROXY_TARGET=https://jira-context-mcp-preview.contacto-80f.workers.dev bun run dev:auth-ui
```

The auth console lets you register, login, copy user tokens, and run a quick MCP initialize/tools test.

To publish the UI inside the Worker, build and deploy with assets:

```bash
bun run deploy:worker:with-ui
```

Preview deploy with UI assets:

```bash
bun run deploy:worker:preview:with-ui
```

Published UI path:

- Preview: `https://jira-context-mcp-preview.contacto-80f.workers.dev/auth`
- Production: `https://jira-mcp-server.creax-ai.com/auth`

### Connecting with Cursor

1. In Cursor, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type **"Connect to MCP Server"**
3. Select **"Connect to MCP Server"**
4. Enter the server URL (recommended: `http://localhost:3000/mcp` for Node or `http://localhost:8787/mcp` for Worker dev)
5. Configure these headers in your MCP client (required for HTTP mode):
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <MCP_AUTH_TOKEN>
   X-Jira-Base-Url: https://your-domain.atlassian.net
   X-Jira-Username: your-email@example.com
   X-Jira-Api-Token: your-api-token-here
   ```

If your MCP client cannot send Jira headers, you can pass Jira parameters as query parameters on `/mcp` (less secure):
`http://localhost:3000/mcp?jiraBaseUrl=...&jiraUsername=...&jiraApiToken=...`

For manual `curl` testing with streamable HTTP, include both content types in `Accept`:
`Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`

- **Duplicate**: "Duplicates" / "Duplicated by"
- **Relates**: "Relates to" / "Relates to"

### 17. Link Issues

Create a relationship between two issues (blocks, relates to, duplicates, etc.):

```
/link_issues inwardIssue:PROJECT-105 outwardIssue:PROJECT-54 linkType:"Blocks" comment:"Bug fix must be completed before feature"
```

**Note**: For "Blocks" links, the inward issue is the one doing the blocking, and the outward issue is the one being blocked.

5. Relate issues that should be worked on together:
   ```
   /link_issues inwardIssue:PROJECT-50 outwardIssue:PROJECT-51 linkType:"Relates"
   ```

**Note**: For "Blocks" links, the inward issue blocks the outward issue. So if PROJECT-105 blocks PROJECT-54, you cannot complete PROJECT-54 until PROJECT-105 is done.
